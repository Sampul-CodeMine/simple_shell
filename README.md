# SIMPLE SHELL &copy; ALX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROGRAMME

Have you made use of a Computer System? Do you have access to a Computer System? If yes then you may have used the Shell program without having a clue to what you actually are using. Every Computer hardware becomes functional with the installation of a software known as the **Operating System**.

The **Operating System** is a low-level software that supports a computer's basic functions, such as, scheduling tasks and controlling peripherals, creating interrupts and handling requests, file management, process management, batch processing and OS monitoring/configuration utilities.

An **Operating System** *(OS)* is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer. The application programs make use of the operating system by making requests for services through a defined application program interface (API).

With that little justling around, what is a *SHELL*? A shell is the outmost layer of an **OS** which serves as an interface to the **OS**. The Shell is a computer program which helps to control processes and files, start and control other programs (application software and utility programs).

The shell manages the interaction between the user of a PC and the Operating system itself by prompting for an input from the user through a *console/command line/terminal*, interpretes the input for the **OS**, renders any resulting output from the **OS**.

The Shell provides a way of communicating with the Operating System. This communication could be carried out in different ways

- interactive communication with the user of the PC through a keyboard or any input device which is acted upon immediately.
- scheduled communication through the use of shell scripts *(a shell script is a file containing a sequence of command known to the Operating System)*.

SHELL is an environment where we can run our commands, programs and shell scripts. They provide us with a **CLI** *(Command Line Interface)* and a prompt alerting the user for a need to issue a command. When the instruction or command is typed and the return key is pressed, the command is sent to the Operating system and it is executed. If there be a resulting output, this is displayed on the CLI and the prompt appears for the next command or instruction to be issued.
  
We have two (2) major types of shells:

- **Bourne Shell**: The Bourne shell is an interactive command interpreter and command programming language. It uses the **$** character as its default prompt. Examples include
  - Bourne Shell - *(.sh)*
  - Korn Shell - *(.ksh)* - backwardly compatible with the Bourne shell and contains most of its features
  - Bourne Again Shell - *(.bash)*
  - POSIX Shell - *(.sh)*
 
- **C Shell**: This is an interactive command interpreter and a command programming language. It uses syntax that is similar to the C programming language. It uses the **%** character as its default prompt. Examples include
  - C Shell - *(.csh)*
  - TENEX/TOPS C Shell - *(.tcsh)*
